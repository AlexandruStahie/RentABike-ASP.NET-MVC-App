# RentABike-ASP.NET-MVC-App


This is one of my first apps in ASP.NET MVC made for a university project, it just has some simple queries, css for design and a simple example of ajax for price calculation. However it is not responsive or anything special, I used FormsAuthentication cookie for login, a little bit Entity Framework for data base connection and connectionString for the written queries. Also, for the moment i'm learning new things and i'm working at the same project but this time with Bootstrap for design, Linq for database connection and queries and maybe some new and more secure authentication method.
